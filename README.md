<h1> Javascript Crash Course  </h1>
<br>
<h6>Below are the sections of what I've learned on my Javascript Journey</h6><br>
<p> I hope this is a help to many, as a person with close to no Javascript prior to creating this. Although, I do have realtivley extensive knowledge in CSS and HTML, I hope it defines the way my descision making is routed.</p>

let a = (10 + 10) / 5;

let b = 4 / 4;

let c = a % b;

console.log(c)

typeOf(a)

let const var 

make sure your naming variables correctly

A string and Number concatenate with '+' instead of adding the numbers up it puts the string alongside the number.

The Modulos or "%" operator gives the remainder of the 2 opperands used in the equation with the "%" being the operator

The difference between == & === is '==' is the equal operator checks if the value is the same as the current value the "===" is the strict equality operator, this operator will only alert true if the value and typeOf are equal otherwise it will return false.

You would recieve a NaN result when adding typical letters with the "+" operator or several other occasions as well.

i++ or ++i
i-- or --i

The difference is pre-fixing the increment operators will start with the initial value given to the incremet operator, using the postfix operator will automatically return 1 higher than initialized with.

Operator precedence is handled by giving ceratain operators in Javascript a higher importance so to say, since operations are read from left to right, a precdence list allows certain operators to come before others even though its being read from left to right.

You're able to access developer tools by going to the browser of your choice right-clicking and choosing the 'Developer Tools' options, depending on your browser which options shows may vary.


You can log information to the console with the simple console.log(blablabla). 

The urnary plus operator is used in a manner such as car = "5", then in order to turn it Number rather than a string you would use (+car + 20) which would return 25, a more useful way than doing Number(car) + 25;
